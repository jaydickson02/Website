# What is the Big Bang?

What was there before the earth? Was it perhaps just a dark, quiet void of nothing or is there more to it? Unfortunatly the name "Big Bang" is next to useless as far a clues go. I'll get a few things out of the way. There was no explosion. In fact there was no point for it to explode from, there is no point where the big bang started from, it happened everywhere all at once, everypoint infinitesimally small started to expand. It got bigger and bigger, it didn't stop and is still expanding to this day. In fact the expansion is accelarating, a phenomenon that still puzzles physicists.

## What caused the Big Bang?

No one knows. Their are theories but these are all constrained by the simple fact that we have no idea what mechanics are at work outside of our universe. Its impossible to comprehend **nothing**. But that is what our universe resides in. Nothing. Existance itself is null and void outside of the universe so the effort to workout what might have kickstarted the Big Bang may be a fruitless endeavour. So instead let focus on what we do know.

## What happened just after the Big Bang?

The universe came into existance, a hot incredibly dense existance. As the universe expanded it began to cool. This allowed matter to begin forming in the early universe. The first quarks and leptons formed but couldn't yet form protons and neutrons the early universe was still too hot. But as it continued to cool the quarks began to form more complex matter. The building fundamental particle that everything to this day are built upon formed. The Neutron and the Proton. It wasn't until a few hundred million more years had passed that the protons and neutrons joined with there lepton cousin the electron to form mostly hydrogen and some helium nuclei. As such the universe as we know it was born, that early matter clumped together to form stars, galaxies and eventually after some trail and error **us**.

## Why is there more matter than anti-matter?

Matter and anti-matter are identical in every respect but there charge. You can use anti-matter to create anything you could make out of regular matter. Both anti-matter and regular matter are formed the same way, exitations of the quantum fields that permiate the universe so it begs the question why is there so much regular matter and no anti-matter as far as we can see? This is another question that has stumped scientists. It isn't clear why one would be chosen over the other. Again a few theories exist but none are yet to be proved experimentally. Some point to the "left-handedness" of the weak nuclear force as a possible explanation violating P-Symmetry and so potentially highlighting a diffrence between matter and anti-matter.
